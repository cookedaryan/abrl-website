          I am involved in teaching with equal emphasis given to the cutting edge research in the Department of Energy Science and Engineering, IIT Delhi. Prior to associate with IIT Delhi, I worked with IIT Bhubaneswar. I received my doctorate in Materials Science and Engineering from the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)  Singapore in 2016. I worked as a research fellow for over two years at NTU Singapore. I was awarded Inspire Faculty Award from the Department of Science & Technology (DST), India in 2017. To further excel my career in energy storage research, I moved to the 
          Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR) Singapore in 2017, and worked as a scientist for nearly two years. At IIT Bhubaneswar, I worked for nearly one year as Assistant Professor, and developed the facilities for smart classrooms experience. I have contributed to various research projects, including electrochemical energy storage using oxide-nanomaterials, miniaturized gas sensor devices based on nanowires and nanosheets assembly, and alkali metal anodes for high performance batteries. My current research interests lie in electrochemical energy storage using metal–sulfur batteries (e.g., Na–S), and flexible and stretchable chemical vapour sensors based on layered materials for environmental applications.

          I am involved in teaching with equal emphasis given to the cutting edge research in the Department of Energy Science and Engineering, IIT Delhi. Prior to associate with IIT Delhi, I worked with IIT Bhubaneswar. I received my doctorate in Materials Science and Engineering from the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)  Singapore in 2016. I worked as a research fellow for over two years at NTU Singapore. I was awarded Inspire Faculty Award from the Department of Science & Technology (DST), India in 2017. To further excel my career in energy storage research, I moved to the 
          Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR) Singapore in 2017, and worked as a scientist for nearly two years. At IIT Bhubaneswar, I worked for nearly one year as Assistant Professor, and developed the facilities for smart classrooms experience. I have contributed to various research projects, including electrochemical energy storage using oxide-nanomaterials, miniaturized gas sensor devices based on nanowires and nanosheets assembly, and alkali metal anodes for high performance batteries. My current research interests lie in electrochemical energy storage using metal–sulfur batteries (e.g., Na–S), and flexible and stretchable chemical vapour sensors based on layered materials for environmental applications.
